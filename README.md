## Special Workshop Tools
Run these HTML files in a web browser. (Need Javascript enabled)

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Workshop Merger](workshop_merger.html) | Merge one workshop into another. Handles merging of rules, variables, and subroutines. Example usage would be to merge a small testing workshop into a larger workshop.
| [Code Finder (Experimental)](code_finder.html) | If you have a list of Workshop Codes, this finds codes similar to a phrase you enter. For example, entering "Tower Defense" with the default codes suggests TP0WR as the best match. Uses the SIFT4 algorithm to match.
